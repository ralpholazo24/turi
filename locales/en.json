      "question": "How does task rotation work?",

      "question": "How do I schedule tasks?",
      "answer": "When creating or editing a task, you can set a frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) and optionally specify a day of the week and time. For monthly tasks, you can also choose which week of the month."
    },
    "faq5": {
      "question": "What is solo mode?",
      "answer": "Solo mode automatically activates when you're the only member in a group. All tasks are assigned to you and rotation is disabled. It switches back to normal rotation when you add more members."
    },
    "faq6": {
      "question": "How do notifications work?",
      "answer": "Enable notifications in Settings, then choose how many minutes before a task is due you want to be reminded. Notifications are only sent for tasks that haven't been completed yet."
    },
    "faq7": {
      "question": "Can I change who's assigned to a task?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can skip turns to move assignments, or edit the task to change which members are assigned to it."
    },
    "faq8": {
      "question": "Where can I see task history?",
