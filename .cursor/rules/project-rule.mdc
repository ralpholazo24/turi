# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 📱 Product Name

**Turi**

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Turi** is a fun, lightweight app that helps groups (families, roommates, teams) manage **recurring shared tasks** — like chores, cooking, or cleaning — by showing **whose turn it is** in a friendly, Duolingo-style interface.

Version 1 (MVP) focuses on **local-only functionality** with **no accounts or cloud sync**, just fast and delightful task rotation.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Simplify managing shared, repetitive tasks.
- Make task tracking fun, visual, and easy to maintain.

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (v1)

- User accounts / authentication.
- Cloud sync or real-time updates.
- Push notifications.
- Analytics / detailed reporting.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. **Groups**

- Create, view, edit, and delete groups.
- Each group has:

  - Name
  - Icon (Lucide icon)
  - Color theme (gradient start/end colors)
  - Member list
  - Task list

### 2. **Members**

- Add members by name (initials-based avatar with random color).
- Order defines task rotation sequence.
- Delete or edit member (swipe-to-reveal actions).
- Avatars display member initials with Microsoft Teams-style color palette.

### 3. **Tasks**

- Add tasks within a group.
- Each task has:

  - Task name
  - Icon (Lucide icon)
  - Frequency (daily / weekly / monthly)
  - Scheduling options (optional):
    - **For weekly tasks:** Day of week (Sun-Sat), Time (optional)
    - **For monthly tasks:** Week of month (1st-4th), Day of week (Sun-Sat), Time (optional)
    - **For daily tasks:** Time (optional)
  - Assigned members (rotation follows member list)
  - Completion history (tracking who completed when)
  - Skip history (tracking who skipped when)

- "Mark Done" button rotates to the next member.
- Tasks can only be completed once per period (daily/weekly/monthly).
- Task cards display schedule information prominently.
- Visual overdue indicators when tasks are past their due period.

### 4. **Rotation Logic**

- Tasks start with the first member in the group list.
- When “Mark Done” is pressed:

  - Assigned index increases by 1.
  - If at the end, wraps to the first member.

Example:

```
Members = [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Task: “Wash Dishes”
CurrentTurn = Alice
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Bob
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Charlie
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Alice
```

### 5. **Local Storage**

- All data stored using **AsyncStorage** (Expo).
- Data structure:

  ```ts
  Group {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    icon: string; // Lucide icon name
    colorStart: string; // Gradient start color
    colorEnd: string; // Gradient end color
    members: Member[];
    tasks: Task[];
  }

  Member {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatarColor: string; // Random color assigned for avatar
  }

  TaskCompletion {
    memberId: string;
    completedAt: string; // ISO date string
  }

  TaskSkip {
    memberId: string;
    skippedAt: string; // ISO date string
  }

  GroupActivity {
    id: string;
    type: 'task_completed' | 'task_skipped' | 'task_created' | 'task_deleted' | 'member_added' | 'member_deleted' | 'group_created';
    timestamp: string; // ISO date string
    actorId?: string; // Member ID who performed the action (optional)
    targetId?: string; // Task ID or Member ID that was affected
    metadata?: {
      taskName?: string;
      taskIcon?: string;
      memberName?: string;
    };
  }

  Task {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    icon: string; // Lucide icon name
    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
    assignedIndex: number;
    memberIds: string[];
    lastCompletedAt: string | null; // ISO date string for completion tracking
    completionHistory: TaskCompletion[]; // History of completions
    skipHistory: TaskSkip[]; // History of skips
    // Scheduling options (optional, only used when frequency is weekly or monthly)
    scheduleWeek?: number; // For monthly: 1-4 (first, second, third, fourth week)
    scheduleDay?: number; // 0-6 (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, ..., Saturday = 6)
    scheduleTime?: string; // HH:MM format (24-hour), e.g., "14:30" for 2:30 PM
  }

  Group {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    icon: string; // Lucide icon name
    colorStart: string; // Gradient start color
    colorEnd: string; // Gradient end color
    members: Member[];
    tasks: Task[];
    createdAt: string; // ISO date string - when group was created
    activities: GroupActivity[]; // Activity feed for this group
  }
  ```

- Storage includes version field for future migrations.

### 6. **Gamification**

- Confetti or celebration animation on completion.
- Motivational messages like "Nice job!" or "Keep it going!"

### 7. **Solo Mode**

- Automatically enabled when a group has only one member.
- Tasks are automatically assigned to the single member.
- Rotation is disabled (tasks remain assigned to the solo user).
- UI elements adjust:
  - "Whose turn" indicators show "You" instead of member name
  - "Assign to" or member selection is hidden
  - "Skip" button is hidden
  - Solo mode badge appears: "Solo mode — all tasks are yours 👤"
- When another member is added, automatically switches to normal rotation mode.

### 8. **Activity Feed**

- Chronological feed of all activities across all groups.
- Activity types tracked:
  - Task completed (who + when)
  - Task skipped (who + when)
  - Task created
  - Task deleted
  - Member added
  - Member deleted
  - Group created
- Filterable by type (All, Done, Skipped, Created, Members).
- Grouped by relative date (Today, Yesterday, This week, specific dates).
- Shows relative time ("Just now", "2h ago", "3d ago").
- Clickable items navigate to task details or group pages.
- Accessible from Settings → Activity.

### 9. **Settings**

## 📋 MVP Implementation Decisions

### Task Assignment

- Default to **all members** assigned to a task.
- Optional subset selection can be added later if needed.

### Frequency Tracking

- Track minimal completion dates (last completed timestamp per task).
- Use frequency (daily/weekly/monthly) for display.
- Tasks can only be completed once per period (prevents duplicate completions).
- Schedule information (week, day, time) stored for weekly and monthly tasks.

### Gamification

- **Simple feedback only** (no streaks for MVP).
- Confetti animation on completion.
- Motivational messages.

### Data Structure

- Use PRD structure with **versioning** for future migrations.
- Add `lastCompletedAt` timestamp to Task for completion tracking.
- Add `completionHistory` array to Task for tracking completion history.
- Add `skipHistory` array to Task for tracking skip history.
- Add `scheduleWeek`, `scheduleDay`, `scheduleTime` to Task for scheduling (weekly/monthly).
- Add `createdAt` timestamp to Group for creation date.
- Add `activities` array to Group for activity feed tracking.
- Groups use Lucide icons and color themes (gradient start/end).
- Members use initials-based avatars with random color assignment.
- Tasks use Lucide icons.
- Activity tracking includes metadata for task names, icons, and member names.

### UI Build Priority

1. Home Screen → Group List
2. Group Screen → Tasks & Members
3. Task Details / Add Modals
4. Gamification Layer (confetti, messages)
5. Settings Screen
6. Activity Feed Screen
7. Solo Mode Implementation
8. UI Polish & Safety (bounds checking, safe area insets, overdue indicators)
