# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 📱 Product Name

**Turi**

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Turi** is a fun, lightweight app that helps groups (families, roommates, teams) manage **recurring shared tasks** — like chores, cooking, or cleaning — by showing **whose turn it is** in a friendly, Duolingo-style interface.

Version 1 (MVP) focuses on **local-only functionality** with **no accounts or cloud sync**, just fast and delightful task rotation.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Simplify managing shared, repetitive tasks.
- Make task tracking fun, visual, and easy to maintain.
- Encourage consistency through small gamified elements.

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (v1)

- User accounts / authentication.
- Cloud sync or real-time updates.
- Push notifications.
- Analytics / detailed reporting.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. **Groups**

- Create, view, and delete groups.
- Each group has:

  - Name
  - Emoji/icon
  - Member list
  - Task list

### 2. **Members**

- Add members by name + emoji avatar.
- Order defines task rotation sequence.
- Delete or edit member (optional in v1).

### 3. **Tasks**

- Add tasks within a group.
- Each task has:

  - Task name
  - Emoji/icon
  - Frequency (daily / weekly)
  - Assigned members (rotation follows member list)

- “Mark Done” button rotates to the next member.

### 4. **Rotation Logic**

- Tasks start with the first member in the group list.
- When “Mark Done” is pressed:

  - Assigned index increases by 1.
  - If at the end, wraps to the first member.

Example:

```
Members = [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Task: “Wash Dishes”
CurrentTurn = Alice
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Bob
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Charlie
→ Mark Done → NextTurn = Alice
```

### 5. **Local Storage**

- All data stored using **AsyncStorage** (Expo).
- Data structure:

  ```ts
  Group {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    emoji: string;
    members: Member[];
    tasks: Task[];
  }

  Member {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    emoji: string;
    streakCount: number;
    lastStreakDate: string | null; // ISO date string
  }

  Task {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    emoji: string;
    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly';
    assignedIndex: number;
    memberIds: string[];
    lastCompletedAt: string | null; // ISO date string for streak calculation
  }
  ```

- Storage includes version field for future migrations.

### 6. **Gamification**

- **Streak counter** for completing tasks (per-user).
- Confetti or celebration animation on completion.
- Motivational messages like "Nice job!" or "Keep it going!"
- **Streak logic:** Resets if user misses their turn on a daily/weekly task.

- [ ] Can add members and tasks.
- [ ] Task rotation correctly cycles through members.
- [ ] Data persists after app restart.
- [ ] UI looks correct on iOS and Android.
- [ ] Confetti triggers on "Mark Done".

## 🚀 Future Versions (Post-v1 Ideas)

- Login and cloud sync (Firebase or Supabase).
- Push notifications for due tasks.
- Custom rotation order.
- Task history and stats.
- Shared links to invite members.
- Themes and advanced gamification (badges, levels, XP system).

---

## 📋 MVP Implementation Decisions

### Task Assignment

- Default to **all members** assigned to a task.
- Optional subset selection can be added later if needed.

### Frequency Tracking

- Track minimal completion dates (last completed timestamp per task).
- Use frequency (daily/weekly) for display and streak calculation.

### Gamification

- **Streaks only** (no XP for MVP).
- Per-user streak tracking.
- Streak resets if user misses their turn on a daily/weekly task.

### Data Structure

- Use PRD structure with **versioning** for future migrations.
- Add `lastCompletedAt` timestamp to Task for streak calculation.
- Add `streakCount` and `lastStreakDate` to Member for tracking.

### UI Build Priority

1. Home Screen → Group List
2. Group Screen → Tasks & Members
3. Task Details / Add Modals
4. Gamification Layer (streaks, confetti, messages)
